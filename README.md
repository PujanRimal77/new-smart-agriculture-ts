# Smart Agriculture System

## Overview
This Smart Agriculture System is a TypeScript-based project designed to enhance agricultural productivity through real-time monitoring and automated management of crops. It integrates various technologies including sensors, mobile applications, and automated irrigation systems.

## Unified Process Artifacts Overview

### 1. Use Case Model
The **Smart Agriculture System** use case model identifies primary interactions, capturing the functional requirements of the system:

- **Actors:**
  - **Farmer:** End-user managing crops and irrigation.
  - **Admin:** Responsible for managing system data and user accounts.
  - **Sensor Device:** Collects real-time agricultural data.

- **Primary Use Cases:**
  - **View Crop Data:** Farmers can view real-time data about their crops.
  - **Monitor Soil Moisture:** System displays soil moisture levels from sensors.
  - **Adjust Irrigation:** Farmers can adjust irrigation settings based on data.
  - **Manage User Accounts (Admin):** Admins add, update, or remove user accounts.
  - **Process Sensor Data:** The system processes data collected from sensors and displays it.

### 2. Design Model
The design model includes architectural decisions:
- **Backend:** RESTful APIs for communication with the frontend and sensor devices.
- **Database:** Mongodb database for storing sensor data and user information.
- **Frontend:** Web-based dashboard for farmers to interact with the system.

### 3. Implementation Artifacts
- **Code Modules:** Divided into user-facing components, service APIs, and utility functions.
- **Test Scripts:** Ensure use case functionalities are robust and bug-free.

### 4. Deployment Model
- Hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure like AWS or Azure.
- Integrated with a CI/CD pipeline for regular updates.
