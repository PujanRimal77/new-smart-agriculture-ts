# Smart Agriculture System

## Overview
This Smart Agriculture System is a TypeScript-based project designed to enhance agricultural productivity through real-time monitoring and automated management of crops. It integrates various technologies including sensors, mobile applications, and automated irrigation systems.

## Features
- Real-time crop data monitoring
- Soil moisture sensing
- Automated irrigation control
- Mobile application interface
- Edge computing for local data processing

## Technologies
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- IoT sensors
- Mobile app development (framework specifics to be added)

# Smart Agriculture System

## Copy-Paste Installation

## Farmer Tests
- **should create a Farmer instance with correct properties**: Ensures correct Farmer object creation
- **viewCropData** should log the correct message: Validates crop data viewing functionality
- **receiveAlerts** should log the correct message: Checks alert reception mechanism
- **adjustIrrigation** should log the correct message: Confirms irrigation adjustment logging

## IrrigationSystem Tests
- **should create an IrrigationSystem instance with correct properties**: Verifies IrrigationSystem initialization
- **adjustWater** should update water flow and log the correct message: Checks water flow adjustment
- **reportStatus** should log the correct message: Validates status reporting

## MobileApp Tests
- **should create a MobileApp instance with correct properties**: Ensures MobileApp object creation
- **displayDashboard** should log the correct message: Checks dashboard display functionality
- **sendCommands** should log the correct message: Validates command sending
- **receiveNotifications** should log the correct message: Confirms notification reception

- All tests passed successfully.
- Observations:
  - EdgeDevice data collection and transmission working as expected.
  - Farmer interface correctly displays crop data and alerts.
  - IrrigationSystem adjusts water flow accurately based on input.
  - MobileApp successfully displays user-specific information.
  - Sensors accurately measure and transmit environmental data.

  No issues were encountered during this test run. The system demonstrates good integration between components, with each module performing its designated functions correctly.
